# Architecture Planning

Select hosting stack and map components to Azure services.

## Stack Selection

| Stack | Best For | Azure Services |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| **Containers** | Docker experience, complex dependencies, microservices | Container Apps, AKS, ACR |
| **Serverless** | Event-driven, variable traffic, cost optimization | Functions, Logic Apps, Event Grid |
| **App Service** | Traditional web apps, PaaS preference | App Service, Static Web Apps |

### Decision Factors

| Factor | Containers | Serverless | App Service |
|--------|:----------:|:----------:|:-----------:|
| Docker experience | ✓✓ | | |
| Event-driven | ✓ | ✓✓ | |
| Variable traffic | | ✓✓ | ✓ |
| Complex dependencies | ✓✓ | | ✓ |
| Long-running processes | ✓✓ | | ✓ |
| Minimal ops overhead | | ✓✓ | ✓ |

## Service Mapping
