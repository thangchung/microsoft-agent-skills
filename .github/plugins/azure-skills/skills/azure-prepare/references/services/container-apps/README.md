# Azure Container Apps

Serverless container hosting for microservices, APIs, and background workers.

## When to Use

- Microservices and APIs
- Background processing workers
- Event-driven applications
- Web applications (server-rendered)
- Any containerized workload that doesn't need full Kubernetes

## Service Type in azure.yaml

```yaml
services:
  my-api:
    host: containerapp
    project: ./src/my-api
    docker:
      path: ./Dockerfile
```
