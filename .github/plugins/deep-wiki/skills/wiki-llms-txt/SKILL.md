# llms.txt Generator

Generate `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` files that provide LLM-friendly access to wiki documentation, following the [llms.txt specification](https://llmstxt.org/).

## When This Skill Activates

- User asks to generate `llms.txt` or mentions the llms.txt standard
- User wants to make documentation "LLM-friendly" or "LLM-readable"
- User asks for a project summary file for language models
- User mentions `llms-full.txt` or context-expanded documentation

## Source Repository Resolution (MUST DO FIRST)

Before generating, resolve the source repository context:

1. **Check for git remote**: Run `git remote get-url origin`
2. **Ask the user**: _"Is this a local-only repository, or do you have a source repository URL?"_
   - Remote URL → store as `REPO_URL`
   - Local → use relative paths only
3. **Determine default branch**: Run `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
4. **Do NOT proceed** until resolved

## llms.txt Format (Spec-Compliant)

The file follows the [llms.txt specification](https://llmstxt.org/):

```markdown
# {Project Name}

> {Dense one-paragraph summary — what it does, who it's for, key technologies}

{Important context paragraphs — constraints, architectural philosophy, non-obvious things}

## {Section Name}

- [{Page Title}]({relative-path-to-md}): {One-sentence description of what the reader will learn}

## Optional

- [{Page Title}]({relative-path-to-md}): {Description — these can be skipped for shorter context}
```

### Key Rules

1. **H1** — Project name (exactly one, required)
2. **Blockquote** — Dense, specific summary (required). Must be unique to THIS project.
3. **Context paragraphs** — Non-obvious constraints, things LLMs would get wrong without being told
4. **H2 sections** — Organized by topic, each with a list of `[Title](url): Description` entries
5. **"Optional" H2** — Special meaning: links here can be skipped for shorter context
6. **Relative links** — All paths relative to wiki directory
7. **Dynamic** — ALL content derived from actual wiki pages, not templates
8. **Section order** — Most important first: Onboarding → Architecture → Getting Started → Deep Dive → Optional

### Description Quality

| ❌ Bad | ✅ Good |
|--------|---------|
| "Architecture overview" | "System architecture showing how Orleans grains communicate via message passing with at-least-once delivery" |
| "Getting started guide" | "Prerequisites, local dev setup with Docker Compose, and first API call walkthrough" |
| "The API reference" | "REST endpoints with auth requirements, rate limits, and request/response schemas" |

## llms-full.txt Format

Same structure as `llms.txt` but with full content inlined:

```markdown
# {Project Name}

> {Same summary}

{Same context}

## {Section Name}

<doc title="{Page Title}" path="{relative-path}">
{Full markdown content — frontmatter stripped, citations and diagrams preserved}
</doc>
```

### Inlining Rules

- **Strip YAML frontmatter** (`---` blocks) from each page
- **Preserve Mermaid diagrams** — keep `` ```mermaid `` fences intact
- **Preserve citations** — all `[file:line](URL)` links stay as-is
- **Preserve tables** — all markdown tables stay intact
- **Preserve `<!-- Sources: -->` comments** — these provide diagram provenance

## Prerequisites

This skill works best when wiki pages already exist (via `/deep-wiki:generate` or `/deep-wiki:page`). If no wiki exists yet:

1. Suggest running `/deep-wiki:generate` first
2. OR generate a minimal `llms.txt` from README + source code scan (without wiki page links)

## Output Files

Generate three files:

| File | Purpose | Discoverability |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| `./llms.txt` | Root discovery file | Standard path per llms.txt spec. GitHub MCP `get_file_contents` and `search_code` find this first. |
| `wiki/llms.txt` | Wiki-relative links | For VitePress deployment and wiki-internal navigation. |
| `wiki/llms-full.txt` | Full inlined content | Comprehensive reference for agents needing all docs in one file. |

The root `./llms.txt` links into `wiki/` (e.g., `[Guide](./wiki/onboarding/contributor-guide.md)`). The `wiki/llms.txt` uses wiki-relative paths (e.g., `[Guide](./onboarding/contributor-guide.md)`).

If a root `llms.txt` already exists and was NOT generated by deep-wiki, do NOT overwrite it.

## Validation Checklist

Before finalizing:

- [ ] All linked files in `llms.txt` actually exist
- [ ] All `<doc>` blocks in `llms-full.txt` have real content (not empty)
- [ ] Blockquote is specific to this project (not generic boilerplate)
- [ ] Sections ordered by importance
- [ ] No duplicate page entries across sections
- [ ] "Optional" section only contains truly optional content
- [ ] `llms.txt` is concise (1-5 KB)
- [ ] `llms-full.txt` contains all wiki pages
