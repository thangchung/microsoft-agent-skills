# Wiki Q&A

Answer repository questions grounded entirely in source code evidence.

## When to Activate

- User asks a question about the codebase
- User wants to understand a specific file, function, or component
- User asks "how does X work" or "where is Y defined"

## Source Repository Resolution (MUST DO FIRST)

Before answering any question, you MUST determine the source repository context:

1. **Check for git remote**: Run `git remote get-url origin` to detect if a remote exists
2. **Ask the user**: _"Is this a local-only repository, or do you have a source repository URL (e.g., GitHub, Azure DevOps)?"_
   - Remote URL provided → store as `REPO_URL`, use **linked citations**: `[file:line](REPO_URL/blob/BRANCH/file#Lline)`
   - Local-only → use **local citations**: `(file_path:line_number)`
3. **Determine default branch**: Run `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
4. **Do NOT proceed** until source repo context is resolved

## Procedure

1. Resolve source repo context (see above)
2. Detect the language of the question; respond in the same language
3. Search the codebase for relevant files
4. Read those files to gather evidence
5. Synthesize an answer with inline linked citations

## Response Format

- Use `##` headings, code blocks with language tags, tables, bullet lists
- Cite sources inline using resolved format:
  - **Remote**: `[src/path/file.ts:42](REPO_URL/blob/BRANCH/src/path/file.ts#L42)`
  - **Local**: `(src/path/file.ts:42)`
- Include a "Key Files" table mapping files to their roles (with linked citations in the "File" column)
- **Include at least 1 Mermaid diagram** when the answer involves architecture, data flow, or relationships — a diagram makes the answer 10x more useful
- **Use tables** for any structured data in the answer (component lists, API endpoints, config options, comparisons)
- If information is insufficient, say so and suggest files to examine

## Rules

- ONLY use information from actual source files
- NEVER invent, guess, or use external knowledge
- Think step by step before answering
