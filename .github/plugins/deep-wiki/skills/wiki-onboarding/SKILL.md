# Wiki Onboarding Guide Generator

Generate four audience-tailored onboarding documents in an `onboarding/` folder, each giving a different stakeholder exactly the understanding they need.

## Source Repository Resolution (MUST DO FIRST)

Before generating any guides, you MUST determine the source repository context:

1. **Check for git remote**: Run `git remote get-url origin` to detect if a remote exists
2. **Ask the user**: _"Is this a local-only repository, or do you have a source repository URL (e.g., GitHub, Azure DevOps)?"_
   - Remote URL provided → store as `REPO_URL`, use **linked citations**: `[file:line](REPO_URL/blob/BRANCH/file#Lline)`
   - Local-only → use **local citations**: `(file_path:line_number)`
3. **Determine default branch**: Run `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
4. **Do NOT proceed** until source repo context is resolved

## When to Activate

- User asks for onboarding docs or getting-started guides
- User runs `/deep-wiki:onboard` command
- User wants to help new team members understand a codebase

## Output Structure

Generate an `onboarding/` folder with these files:

```
onboarding/
├── index.md                    # Onboarding hub — links to all 4 guides with audience descriptions
├── contributor-guide.md        # For new contributors (assumes Python or JS background)
├── staff-engineer-guide.md     # For staff/principal engineers
├── executive-guide.md          # For VP/director-level engineering leaders
└── product-manager-guide.md    # For product managers and non-engineering stakeholders
```

### `index.md` — Onboarding Hub

A landing page with:
- **One-paragraph project summary**
- **Guide selector table**:

| Guide | Audience | What You'll Learn | Time |
|-------|----------|-------------------|------|
| [Contributor Guide](./contributor-guide.md) | New contributors with Python/JS experience | Setup, first PR, codebase patterns | ~30 min |
| [Staff Engineer Guide](./staff-engineer-guide.md) | Staff/principal engineers | Architecture, design decisions, system boundaries | ~45 min |
| [Executive Guide](./executive-guide.md) | VP/directors of engineering | Capabilities, risks, team topology, investment thesis | ~20 min |
| [Product Manager Guide](./product-manager-guide.md) | Product managers | Features, user journeys, constraints, data model | ~20 min |

## Language Detection

Scan the repository for build files to determine the primary language for code examples:
- `package.json` / `tsconfig.json` → TypeScript/JavaScript
- `*.csproj` / `*.sln` → C# / .NET
- `Cargo.toml` → Rust
- `pyproject.toml` / `setup.py` / `requirements.txt` → Python
- `go.mod` → Go
- `pom.xml` / `build.gradle` → Java

- **Quick Reference Card** — Cheat sheet of most-used commands and patterns

### Rules
- All code examples in the detected primary language
- Every command must be copy-pasteable with expected output
- **Minimum 5 Mermaid diagrams** (architecture, ER, sequence, flowchart, state)
- Use Mermaid for workflow diagrams (dark-mode colors) — add `<!-- Sources: ... -->` comment block after each
- Ground all claims in actual code — cite using linked format

## Guide 2: Staff Engineer Guide

**File**: `onboarding/staff-engineer-guide.md`
**Audience**: Staff/principal engineers who need the "why" behind every decision. Deep systems experience, may not know this repo's language.
**Length**: 800–1200 lines. Dense, opinionated, architectural.

### Required Sections

1. **Executive Summary** — What the system is in one dense paragraph. What it owns vs delegates.
2. **The Core Architectural Insight** — The SINGLE most important concept. Include pseudocode in a DIFFERENT language from the repo.
3. **System Architecture** — Full Mermaid `graph TB` diagram. Call out the "heart" of the system.
4. **Domain Model** — Mermaid `erDiagram` of core entities. Data invariants table: Entity, Invariant, Enforced By, Source.
5. **Key Abstractions & Interfaces** — `classDiagram` showing load-bearing abstractions.

- Every claim backed by linked citation
- **Minimum 5 Mermaid diagrams** (architecture, ER, class, sequence, state, flowchart)
- Each diagram followed by `<!-- Sources: ... -->` comment block
- **Use tables aggressively** — decisions, dependencies, debt should ALL be tables with Source columns
- Focus on WHY decisions were made, not just WHAT exists

### Rules
- **ZERO engineering jargon** — no "middleware", "dependency injection", "ORM". Use plain language.
- **User-centric framing** — describe everything in terms of what users experience, not how code works
- **Minimum 3 Mermaid diagrams** (user journey, data model, feature map/capability overview)
- Tables for every structured finding — PMs scan tables, not prose
- If a technical concept must be mentioned, explain it in one sentence (e.g., "Feature flags — toggles that let us turn features on/off without deploying code")
- Every claim grounded in evidence — cite wiki sections or source files for verification

## Mermaid Diagram Rules (ALL guides)

ALL diagrams must use dark-mode colors:
- Node fills: `#2d333b`, borders: `#6d5dfc`, text: `#e6edf3`
- Subgraph backgrounds: `#161b22`, borders: `#30363d`
- Lines: `#8b949e`
- If using inline `style` directives, use dark fills with `,color:#e6edf3`
- Do NOT use `<br/>` in Mermaid labels (use `<br>` or line breaks)

## Validation

After generating each guide, verify:
- All file paths mentioned actually exist in the repo
- All class/method names are accurate (not hallucinated)
- Mermaid diagrams render (no syntax errors)
- No bare HTML-like tags (generics like `List<T>`) outside code fences — wrap in backticks
- Each guide is appropriate for its audience — no code in Executive/PM guides
