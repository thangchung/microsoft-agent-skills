# Microsoft Foundry - Complete Documentation Index

> Microsoft Foundry (formerly Azure AI Foundry) is a unified Azure platform-as-a-service for enterprise AI operations, model builders, and application development. It combines production-grade infrastructure with friendly interfaces for building agents, deploying models, and developing generative AI applications with built-in enterprise-readiness including tracing, monitoring, evaluations, and safety controls.

## Quick Start

**Portal**: https://ai.azure.com

**SDK Installation**:
```bash
# Python
pip install azure-ai-projects azure-ai-agents azure-identity

# .NET
dotnet add package Azure.AI.Projects

# TypeScript/JavaScript
npm install @azure/ai-projects @azure/identity

# Java
<!-- Add to pom.xml -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
  <artifactId>azure-ai-projects</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

**Authentication Pattern**:
```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
client = AIProjectClient(
    endpoint="https://<resource>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project>",
    credential=credential
)
```

**Key Features**:
- **Agent Development**: Build persistent agents with function calling, file search, code interpreter
- **Model Deployment**: Deploy and manage LLMs, embeddings, and vision models
- **Evaluations**: Built-in evaluation tools for quality, safety, and performance
- **Observability**: Tracing, logging, and monitoring for production AI
- **Safety**: Content filtering, guardrails, and responsible AI tools
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Integrate external tools and data sources
