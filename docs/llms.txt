# Microsoft Foundry

> Microsoft Foundry (formerly Azure AI Foundry) is a unified Azure platform-as-a-service for enterprise AI operations, model builders, and application development. It provides a comprehensive set of AI capabilities for building agents, deploying models, and developing generative AI applications with built-in enterprise-readiness including tracing, monitoring, evaluations, and safety controls.

Important information:

- Microsoft Foundry unifies agents, models, and tools under a single management grouping
- The platform supports two portal versions: Foundry (classic) and Foundry (new)
- Foundry projects are the recommended project type for building agents and working with models
- The Foundry SDK is available for Python, C#, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Java
- All URLs require `?view=foundry` parameter to access the new documentation
